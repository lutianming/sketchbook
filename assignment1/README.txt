* interactions
1. filtering cities by population: use UP and Down to set the filter treshhold
2. show name with mouse: move mouse into the circle of the city

* data representation
Use different circle size to distinguish cities with different population.
Bigger circle size will have lower alpha value so that we can see other smaller cities covered.
Use different brightness to distinguish cities with different density.
Use excentric labelling to show the labels of overlapping cities.
